  <description><![CDATA[
    Open files quickly by organizing them in separate lists.
    The lists are defined by going to [Settings|TabSwitcher Extreme] and specifying regex patters for their (full) filenames, e.g.
     <br><br>
    .*xml for files ending with .xml<br>
    .*Activity_.* for files with "Activity_" in their name<br><br>


    (One list per line)<br><br>
    If any file is not matched by any of the regex patterns, a new list named "Other" is created, where it is then placed.<br>


    <br>Initially the plugin binds under alt-A, but one might bind it under ctrl-tab as this is where the standard switcher is.
    <br>
    Usage: Hold alt, press A to activate the plugin. Keep holding alt while moving the selection around using arrow keys and pageup and pagedown.<br>
    <br>Obviously, the plugin needs work, but it's functional. <a href="https://github.com/xorgate/TabSwitcherExtreme">Plugin on github</a>

    <br>Thanks to Bas Leijdekkers for <a href="https://github.com/BasLeijdekkers/TabSwitch">the original plugin (github)</a> this one is based off of.
